# Spotify_Data_Exploration

You can download the Dataset from Kaggle using the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandeepkumar7372/spotify-dataset).

<br>

I have solved the Business Problem by using SQL and Python Both.

<br>

You can check my approach for Python Solution using the [link]().

<br>
<hr>
For Solution using SQL, Go through with the following: 

<br>
<br>
Create the Table using the following query before importing the Dataset in Database:

<br>
<br>

> I have created the Table with the name `"spotify"`

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
```

```
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```


#### Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Table to get the Better Understand about the Table `Spotify`.

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to know more about the Dataset ðŸ”Ž

<hr>

```
select count(*) from spotify;
```

<br>

#### Count the Distinct Artist in "Artist" Column.

```
select count(distinct artist) from spotify;
```

<br>

#### Count the Distinct Album present in the Column

```
select count(distinct album) from spotify;
```

<br>

#### Count the Distinct Artist present in the Column

```
select count(distinct artist) from spotify;
```

<br>

#### Maximum "Duration_min"

```
select max(duration_min) from spotify;
```

<br>

#### Minimum "Duration_Min"

```
select min(duration_min) from spotify;
```
<br>

#### Selecting the Rows with 0 Duration_Min

```
select * from spotify
where duration_min = 0;
```

<br>

#### Deleting the Rows of Duration_min column with the value 0 and Validating the Data.

```
delete from spotify
where duration_min = 0;
select * from spotify
where duration_min = 0;
```
