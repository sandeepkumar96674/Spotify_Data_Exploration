# Spotify_Data_Exploration

You can download the Dataset from Kaggle using the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandeepkumar7372/spotify-dataset).


Create the Table using the following query before importing the Dataset in Database:

> I have created the Table with the name `"spotify"`

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
```

```
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,

    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
